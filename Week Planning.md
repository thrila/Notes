### Step 1
 - Brain dump all your tasks for the week 
 
### Step 2
- **Prioritize** : cross out things you cant do that week or things that are not actionable

Then we Organize the data into 4 different categories


| P0  | P1  | P2  | Dependant |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
|Super Important | Important | Not as Important | Depends on another person|

### Step 3
- Assign days to accomplish tasks

|DOs | DONTs|
|----|------|
|Give Time for Fun| Over pack your Week|
|Make A flexible Schedule | Make A rigid(Set in Stone)Schedule|
| Give certain Tasks Extra Time| Give tasks you have no idea how long it will take to complete fix time frames|
|Set breaks(time to switch between activity)| Leave no time for breaks|
|Set time for eating, transport| |
